# Video Search by Image Query

This project allows users to search for videos by providing an image as a query. It leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to match images to video frames, making it easy to find relevant video content based on an image.

## Features

- **Image-Based Search**: Upload an image and retrieve a list of videos where that image or a similar frame appears.
- **Real-Time Results**: Fast and efficient processing of images to find video matches.
- **Video Thumbnail Previews**: Display thumbnails of videos along with metadata (e.g., video title, description).
- **Customizable Query Parameters**: Fine-tune the search with filters based on video length, resolution, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend for processing image queries.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and comparison.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For image feature extraction using pre-trained models.
- **FFmpeg**: For video frame extraction.
- **Flask/Django**: For building the web API.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend interface for users to upload images and view search results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-search-by-image-query.git
   cd video-search-by-image-query
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install OpenCV and TensorFlow (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow
   ```

5. Install FFmpeg for video frame extraction. Follow the [FFmpeg installation guide](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

6. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the application.

## Usage

1. Upload an image to the search bar.
2. The system processes the image and matches it to video frames.
3. Relevant videos are listed with thumbnails and metadata.

## API Endpoints

### `/search`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Accepts an image file and returns a list of matching video results.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `image`: The image file to search for.
- **Response**: A JSON object with video results including video title, thumbnail, and video URL.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "video_title": "Nature Documentary",
      "thumbnail_url": "http://example.com/thumb1.jpg",
      "video_url": "http://example.com/video1.mp4"
    },
    {
      "video_title": "City Travel Guide",
      "thumbnail_url": "http://example.com/thumb2.jpg",
      "video_url": "http://example.com/video2.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
```
